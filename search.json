    "text": "Welcome to our project on modeling pneumococcal disease, a leading cause of death in children under 5 worldwide. Public health is an interdisciplinary field that measures and tracks disease trends and promotes health through policy and treatment interventions. We will investigate the impact of pneumococcal vaccines and the phenomenon of serotype replacement, where uncommon serotypes variations not targeted by the therapy flourish and take over as the predominant causes of disease after vaccination. Using data from infectious disease surveillance systems and statistical methods such as time series analysis, hierarchical modeling, and serotype clustering and association, we aim to understand serotype replacement and its implications. Our analyses will be conducted in R.\nOur objectives for this course will be to:\nWe will accomplish these objectives using data from national and multinational infectious disease surveillance systems, and the following statistical methods:\nFull project statement"
